# Predicting CTR

Now that we have extracted and joined our ad features into a working dataset. It's prediction time! 

Originally, we wanted to go deep learning all the way. And developed a mixed input model that took in image data and numerical data and spat out the expected CTR.

However the results were disappointing. R2 of 0.057944 and MSE at 0.00678.
