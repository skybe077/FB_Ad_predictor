# Facebook Ad CTR Predictor 
Predict the Click-Through-Rate of a Facebook ad based on audience targeting parameters, Ad creatives (Image + Copy). 
Currently R2 is 0.493. Depending on threshold (+/- $0.60), this predictor was useful for 60 to 70% of the time.   


## Motivations  
Social media advertising tends to be hit and miss. Commomly media marketers wouldn't know if an ad works until its been running for 2 weeks. But that means it's 2 weeks of money gone to waste -- if the ad is low performing. What can we do to get the most bang out of limited bucks? 

All we have before a campaign runs is an ad and a set of target parameters (e.g. work positions, countries, interests). Based on that information, can we predict an Ad's performance? 

Apparently, yes. 

## Predecessors 
A Google search turns up quite a number of papers and approaches with respect to predicting advertising performance. Scroll down to the end for the links to the papers.
TLDR: 
1. Model ensembles are used to extract features from ad creatives & basic user data
2. The features are pushed into Logistic Regression to predict if an ad is clicked on or otherwise by a user
3. These approaches rely on getting access to user data and ad logs (most companies won't have access to it) 

As much as I'd like to copy and use the models, it's not going to work. I simply will never have access to user / ad-level data that these researchers have. But there are things that we can reuse -- particularly in feature extraction.
