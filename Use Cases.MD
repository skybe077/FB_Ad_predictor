## Use Cases for an Ad Predictor 

Seriously? For the sake of completeness, here we go.

1. Test ad performance before it goes live. Upload ad copy, images, and targeting parameters to get its expected CTR  
2. Extract important ad features grouped by metadata  
3. Develop creative guidelines that could lead to higher CTRs (e.g. images with faces really get higher CTRs)  
4... If you've any ideas, please contact me and I'll chuck it in with due credit.
